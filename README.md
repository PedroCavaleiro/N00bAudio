# N00bAudio
Small Audio Processing Software developped by me and other 3 colleagues for my course's subject "Multimedia".
# The Code
This code is not optimized neither is a 100% working it's just proof of concept.
# Notes
This isn't real time audio processing.
It opens an a uncompressed .wav
Renders an WaveForm of the file 
You can export as project and reload it. You can also export as .wav

The UI is a bit sketchy but the main objective on this project was Opening and Saving a wav file and modifing the audio.

Hope it helps someone.
